# AlexNet + Convolutions + GPUs
- ImageNet
- Jumpstarted the vision/image processing community. Huge advance. Subsequent progress.
- Powerful inductive bias
  - Nearby pixels in an image have a relationship to each other 
  - Fully connected would not assume anything like this, would have to discover

# Convolutional layers visualized
- Layers deeper learn more advanced features. 
- Final layer performs task specific operation

# Adverserial inputs
- Follow naturally from being able to find high activations for inputs.
- Make a stop sign read as a green light

- House pricing example. 
    - Many examples. Pricing + features. Something discoverable.
