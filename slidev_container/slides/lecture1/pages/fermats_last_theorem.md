- Finally, this guy comes along.
- Look at him, Truly a mathematician's mathematician.
  - Hair
  - Glasses
  - Even the sweater!
  - This guy does math!

- Creates a proof so complex, using math that only a handful of people in the world know. 
- Work can't be checked by mere mortals.
- Is it solved, is it not? More compelling than I'm making it sound

Ok, so Fermat probably didn't have a proof.

My version: Universal Approximation Theorem
"There is a proof that exists, a marvelous proof, but I'm too dumb to explain it." 
Look it up if you're interested.
I'm sold, I don't need to check their work.
