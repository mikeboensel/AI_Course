- Too often things are taught academically to be 100% technically accurate
    - Taught by people who are experts in the field. They want you to see the work they put in. They want you to appreciate their suffering.
    - I have a different approach. Get 90% of the meaning. Fill it in later. Explain it in a way that rather than saying "Goddam that guy is smart" its more like "Why didn't I get into engineering. A monkey could do this". 
        - There is OFC more to this than I'm initially discussing, but I think its hugely helpful to start from a place of "Oh, ok, I get what you're doing and where you're going" vs "I don't know any of those words. I'm not even sure what the point of this is, I'm drowing in terminology"

- Motivating example
    - I'd argue a lot of the Math that we all learn through school is just about developing a numbering system and some basic operations around that.
    - Pretty good student. Better at math than most as I ended up going into engineering, which means to me I can talk with authority to anyone other than mathematicians and physicists.
        - Did not have good intuitions on any of this, just really good at applying mechanical processes that were drilled into me via worksheets/hw
            - Competitive streak + gamifying
    - Many of these concepts are bizarre! We forget how hard they were for us initially. Worth exploring.
    - About 10 years ago I went back to kindergarten math -> Calc 2 using Khan Academy
        - Seeing the whole picture (and knowing where we're going is hugely helpful, otherwise you're being led around by the nose)
    - So let's work through most of what we spent 8+ years of schooling learning,  starting with a # line:
        - <0-> 10 # line>
        - Counting (ok, makes sense, I have fingers. Eventually I can imagine that there are even things beyond what I can enumerate on my fingers)
            - A more general concept, a displacement from the origin (0)
            - Eventual expansion to large #s (beyond what we've seen in front of us). Millions of blocks. Ok. 
                - Then infinity
        - Addition (Just expanding on counting)
        - Subtraction (Removal from some quantity)
            - What happens if we go beyond what we have?
                - Negatives are weird. More so than we think.
                    - Easier for us to reason about due to debt. We can understand oweing someone money. 
                    - But none of us have ever seen a "negative thing"
                        - All in relation to some state. A proton is denoted as "positive". What's the inverse of that? A "negative". It makes sense to use this terminology since the 2 cancel out +1/-1. But again, there's not such thing as a "negative thing". But, its a useful concept of moving to the left on the # line
        - Is 1 the smallest unit of measure?
            - Seems dumb, mostly because we've all absorbed the abstract concept, but you can make arguments about fractions also being in relation to something and not really existing.
            - 1/2 Pizza - Abstract idea that there should be more there. There isn't. But there should be. Hence you have half.
            - Most things if you take half, a quarter, a tenth, you just have junk. Possibly unrecognizable junk depending on how it was split.
                - 1/10 of a car engine. Misc parts.
        - Multiplication
            - Like repeated addition
            - Scaling a displacement
            - What if we scaled by a # less than 1?
                - Division!
            - By a negative #?
                - Flip along the axis
        - Exponents
            - Scaling even harder
            - Doing this by a # < 1?
                - Square (or arbitrary n) root
            - What about w/ a # < 1?
                - Imaginary # (a half flip!)
    - 

    - Ok, but that's leaving off some subjects
        - Trig - Triangle tricks
            - Why?
            - We've dealth with a single point (a #). Dealth with 2 points (slope, distance, etc.). Triangle is what you get when you have 3 points, actually turns out to be hugely useful.
            - Circular movement modeled as 3 points (origin, x-offset, y-offset)
                - AC current (generators)
                    - So that's why sin/cos show up everywhere in electrical engineering
        - Calc
            - We know how to do area and slope for simple stuff
                - What about wiggly lines?


- No one wants to look dumb, and so we end up all talking past each other, minimizing learning
    - Fortunately, I'm used to looking dumb... hence : Mr Big Brain's Super Duper AI Course


- What is AI?
    - Nebulous term. Basically, "computer doing something useful". 
    - Spellcheck
        - Not particularly smart. 
        - But at one time revolutionary.
            - Brings up another 
    - Marketing term
        - Mentions of AI during investor conference calls
    - Umbrella term
        - Machine Learning is what has generated all the interesting progress, that's what we'll focus on
            - "Learning from data examples"
                - Instructing a machine is hard. Humans are bad at considering a state space. May not even be able to describe (or know) how to find a solution.
                    - Bouncer example.
                        - Task: Don't allow anyone through the door unless they are of age.
                            - Sounds simple (Gate access to one entry point, )
                            - What does that mean? People should be 18+ years old
                            - Which IDs? Other states? Passports? Foreign IDs? Driver's licences only?
                            - Where to find the DOB information?
                            - Someone shows up with a 2 digit year "12" are they 112? Or 12?
                            - Stop people from entering the door w/o checking ID
                                - What about the window?
                            - Tremendous amount of prior knowledge about the world must either be present, or accounted for by programmer. 
                            - Many failure modalities
                    - House pricing example. 
                        - Many examples. Pricing + features. Something discoverable.
