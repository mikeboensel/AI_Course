# Talk Goals: Something for everyone
- Threading a needle here
- Newbie accessible
  - High level understanding
    - Details might be overwhelming
  - A roadmap to learn

- Something for those already in the field
  - Insights
  - Resources you haven't seen before
  - (Hopefully)


<!--
- Everyone feels dumb in this field. TBH I think its poorly understood even by experts. 
- If you have a question, chances are other people do.
- Encourage you to ask. 

- Too often things are taught academically to be 100% technically accurate
    - Taught by people who are experts in the field. 
    - I'm not an expert.
    - Just want a solid intuition.
    - Approach (to this and SW in general):
      - Explain it in a way that rather than saying "Goddam that guy is smart" its more like "Why didn't I get into engineering. A monkey could do this". 
      - A bit reductionist. 
        - OFC more to this than I'm mentioning 
        - Helpful to start from a place:
          "Oh, ok, I get what you're doing and where you're going" 
            vs 
          "I don't know any of those words. I'm not even sure what the point of this is, I'm drowing in terminology"
