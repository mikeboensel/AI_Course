# The Hedonic Treadmill
- Indulge me on a brief philosophical aside
- Our approach to all consumption follows this pattern
    - (Tech is something we consume)
- Brief satisfaction followed by disillusionment

<!-- 
Instructive 
Manifests itself in many different ways:
- Memes
- Social media
- Gartner Hype Cycle
- Etc.

But all fundamentally stem from the same thing-->

# Consumption
- An evolutionary holdover
    - "Give me more, give me better, now!".
    - Resource constrained in the past, so self-restraint was not rewarded
- Always strive for more

<!--
- We became really good at detecting what's calorie rich.
- We crave it.
- We can tell when something is a knock-off/diet food
- Used to not get much of it and it was really beneficial (we don't starve, hooray), now we get a ton, adverse impact

Is this guy Zen? Divorced from the world and its temptations? IDK. But he certainly looks the part.

"An attitude of Gratitude" - Door mat or bumper sticker

Buddhism/self-mastery. Not our fault, but must temper.
