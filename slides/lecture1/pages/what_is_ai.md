# Umbrella term

<!-- Inner elements are normally some mix of: 
- Stats
- Computer Science
- Machine Learning
- Neural Networks
- Deep Learning
- "Big Data"
- Data Science
A fair amount of these terms are themselves vague catch-alls.

# A moving target
- Basically, **a computer doing something useful and impressive**.
- Ex: Spellcheck. Revolutionary at some point, now, not so much.

<!--
Simple enough algo:
- For each word
- Check if in dictionary
- If not, add a red squiggle below
BONUS: Add suggestions on hover via something like nearest Levenstein distance
  - The # of single-character edits (insertions, deletions or substitutions) required to change one word into the other. 

Intentionally picked something that the audience would find trite to make a point. 
- Been in this field a while, I can remember things that blew my mind at the time:
  - Google auto-complete
  - GMail updating w/o page refreshes (AJAX)
- All common place/unexceptional now. Revolutionary at the time. This is the course of all technology

- Main driver of recent progress

- Definition: **Learning an underlying structure from limited data examples**

- Let's examine why this is interesting
