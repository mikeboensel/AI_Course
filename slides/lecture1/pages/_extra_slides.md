# Model capacity
- More line segments allow for more accurate following of the data
- Deeper networks tend to be more efficient

# The importance of Datasets
- Collection/labeling of data is a very expensive endeavor
- Even collection of "unlabeled data" is expensive
    - Scraping, storage
- Having readily available datasets for different domains facilitates research

# What gets measured gets done
- Competitions encourage regular progress
- Contests around different datasets
- Metrics can be hard! Accuracy used to be enough
- Most of the progress recently has been in LLMs, more difficult to score/setup challenges
    - Interesting approach from <a href="https://arena.lmsys.org/"> Chatbot arena</a> 
    - ELO system and head to head contests

# Elo in detail
- TLDR; Beat higher rated opponents, move up quickly


<!-- Love a good inscrutable graph! It must be telling me something really important, let's stare at it until it gives up its secrets.
